        "Although we believe the emergency of the first cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, is an astonishing accomplishment for the entire human race (and the possibilities lying in front of us are yet to be recognized), the reason to create our own cryptocurrency is high volatility of the former, which prevents the Rating system from working correctly. The rates directly correlate to the amount of donations, purchases, transactions and etc. If such parameters fluctuate, the received rating will change as well, which can have a negative effect on the accuracy of the system in general. Rating is one of the key modules, thus the entire ecosystem of the project depends on the stability of the used cryptocurrency rate."

        "It shall be mentioned that today gold is not a perfect candidate for a reference stability standard, however its volatility is acceptable for a correct functioning of the Rating system. Thus, the exchange rate of webGold has been initially pegged to the Gold Standard, and at the moment of the launch 1,000 WRG = 1 g of gold (1 WRG = 1 mg of gold).",
        "At the same time the free market of cryptocurrencies is beyond anyone’s control and may be determined through supply and demand only, and thus webGold value will eventually change. Since the emission of WRG is strictly regulated by the emission rules based on the distribution of DAO tokens, as the number of users and the amounts accumulated in their wallets grow, and taking into account however small but constant decrease in the number of circulated webGold coins due to natural reasons (loss of access keys, abandoned accounts, and etc.), the demand will outpace the supply leading to the increase of the initial webGold value. In other words, at a certain stage webGold’s value will, presumably, become independent of gold and will exceed its cost, and thus the reference to the cost of gold will serve only as a lower limit by the currency evaluation.",
        "To sum it up, webGold possesses the following distinguishing features:",
        "* no direct limits on the issue of coins, yet standing emission rules will ensure an accurate correlation of webGold coins to DAO tokens",
        "* the “Gold Standard” and, as a consequence, poor speculative possibilities guarantee a stable yet potentially deflationary rate, and turn webGold into a perfect choice for preserving and accumulating of funds",
        "* network members will be granted equal rights regardless of the stage they joined the project",
        "* a cryptocurrency with an open source code that does not depend on and is not controlled by banks, governments or any other parties. Technical details will be discussed in “How it Works” section"
